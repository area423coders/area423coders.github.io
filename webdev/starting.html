A "website" sounds simple, but in practice they can be very complicated. At the heart of it all though, a website consists of a few things:
* files containing text and markup (*.html)
* files containing style information (*.css)
* files that enable dynamic interactions (*.js)
* software that responds to requests by providing the files (the server)
* a place to store it all (the host)

To create our first website, we will simply create some HTML files, upload them to our host, which will also act as the server.

Our host is going to be github. Github is more than just a webhost, and we will learn all about it eventually. For now, all you need to do is make a github account. https://github.com

Once you've done this, follow step 1 on this page https://pages.github.com. Copy the link to the repository you just made to yoru clipboard (Command+C), or just leave the web browser open.

Now, we need to set up our computer so that we can work with github seamlessly (SSH?).

Next, we will use Xcode to edit our files. Open Xcode and create a new workspace. Then, go to "Source Control" and select "Check Out..." and then paste the link for your github repository.
